# ![Link Manager logo](https://oleksiyrudenko.github.io/gd-linkman/favicon-96x96.png "Link Manager logo") Link Manager for Google Driveâ„¢

Native link sharing of files from Google Drive offers 
opening native Google documents or preview mode 
for other types of files.

This tool integrates with Google Drive and offers:
 * convert-and-download direct links for native Google documents
 * direct download links for other types of files
 
## Problem

When you share a link to a file located on Google Drive your vis-a-vis may face:
* need to switch to a Google account in order to access native Google documents;
* inability to access native Google documents when vis-a-vis has got no Google account;
* take extra step to download other types of files as by default those are opened in a preview mode;
* inability to access any file if access permissions aren't set properly.

## Solution

This tool will help you to improve your peers'
experience when downloading files.

You will also skip _export-upload-share_ hassle 
for native Google documents with sharing direct
export-and-download links.

This tool diminishes quite a few otherwise unavoidable actions,
but on scale it saves lots of efforts.

Take care of your peers!

## To do

Add url shortening feature to enable tracking
and make links in emails or other documents
incorporating those look neater.
