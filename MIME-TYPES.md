# Supported MIME types

Seems like
[Google Drive API settings](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/drive_sdk)
doesn't allow describing generalized MIME types like
`image/*`, `application/*` etc.

It also seems that it doesn't actually support
app association with file extensions.
