# Google Drive File Link Management

A Google Drive application to manage file links.

```Note: __GDSS__ stands for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides.```

When you share a link to a file located on Google Drive your vis-a-vis 
may face:
 * need to switch to a google account in order to access GDSS
 * inability to access GDSS when vis-a-vis has got no google account
 * take extra step to download other types of files as by default those
   are opened in a preview mode
 * inability to access any file if access permissions aren't
   set properly

You may also want to track access activities.
