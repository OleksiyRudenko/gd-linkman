Please, check if the bug report or feature request is not
listed by someone else.

 1. Complete the request:
    - what is the current behaviour?
    - what is the expected behaviour?
    - how would you reproduce the current behavior (if this is a bug)?

## Submitting code

Employ the process that ends up in pull request.

If your patch is going to be large it might be a good idea to 
get the discussion started early. We are happy to discuss it 
in a new issue beforehand.

Make sure that patches provide justification for why they 
should be merged. 
Link Manager for Google Drive is an opinionated project and 
as such, patches which add support for alternative choices 
to those we prescribe are not guaranteed to land.

We ask that you squash all the commits together before pushing.
